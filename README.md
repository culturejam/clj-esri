## Getting Started

Include in your project.clj:

:dependencies [[clj-esri '0.1.0-SNAPSHOT']]
```

Require:

```clj
(require 'clj-esri.core :as 'esri)
```

## Example

```clj
(esri/with-https
  (esri/with-arcgis-config "www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest" ;arcgis-online-endpoint
                           "services1.arcgis.com/yourorgid/arcgis/rest/services" ;arcgis-server-endpoint
    ;You probably want to cache your access-token
    (let [access-token
          (:token (esri/generate-token esri-username
                                       esri-password
                                       "referer"
                                       :referer "example.com"))]
      (esri/with-token access-token
          (let [response-get-services (esri/get-services)]
            (print "Get services: " response-get-services)))))
```
